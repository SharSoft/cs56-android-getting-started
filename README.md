# cs56-android-getting-started
A CS56 project that describes how to get started with Android Programming in the context of CS56


* This is a work in progress.

* The goal is that by the end of W15, this README.md will contain, or point to, resources within the repo that describe how to do Android programming in the context of CS56 for legacy code projects.

* Those resources may be in this very README.md, or if that gets too cumbersome, they might be in other files in the .md format stored in the repo, and linked to from here.

Some older resources that might be helpful to compare (even though they are way out of date) are here:
